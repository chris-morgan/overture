/**
    Function: O.sortByProperties

    Creates a comparison function which takes two objects and returns -1/0/1 to
    indicate whether the first object is before or after the other. Comparison
    is made by considering each of the properties in the array in turn on the
    two objects until the objects have non-equal values for a property. If the
    property values are integer like strings, they will first be converted to
    numbers for comparison. Other strings will be compared case-insensitively.

    Parameters:
        properties - {String[]} The properties to sort the objects by, in
                     order of precedence. Can also supply just a String for one
                     property.

    Returns:
        {Function} This function may be passed to the Array#sort method to
        sort the array of objects by the properties specified.
