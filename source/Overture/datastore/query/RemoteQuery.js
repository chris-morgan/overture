/**
    Class: O.RemoteQuery

    Extends: O.Object

    Includes: O.Enumerable, O.ObservableRange

    A remote query is conceptually an array of records, where the contents of
    the array is calculated by a server rather than the client. In its simplest
    form, you would use remote query like this:

        var query = new O.RemoteQuery({
            store: TodoApp.store
            Type: TodoApp.TodoItem,
            filter: 'done',
            sort: 'dateAscending'
        });

    Your data source connected to the store must support the fetchQuery method
    (either directly or via a handler in the queryFetchers property). This
    should fetch the list of record ids that are the result of the query and
    pass this to the query via the sourceDidFetchQuery callback. To reduce round
    trips, you may also like to fetch the records themselves as part of this
    handler, but this is optional; if you do not, after the ids have been
    loaded, any observers will fetch the records they want from the query. This
    will in turn get them from the store, which will request any unloaded
    records from the source as normal.

    The sort and filter properties may have arbitrary value and type. They are
    there so your fetchQuery handler in source knows what to fetch. If they are
    changed, the query is refetched. The sort and filter properties in the
    object passed to the sourceDidFetchQuery callback must be identical to the
    current values in the query for the data to be accepted.

    The server may also return a state string, which represents the current
    state of the query. The source may then send this to the server if the query
    is refreshed; if there have been no changes, the server can then avoid
    sending back unneccessary data.
