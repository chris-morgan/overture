    NOTE(circular-imports): there are several circular imports in the Overture
    codebase still. Provided the circular references don’t get hit immediately
    (that is, provided the circularly-referenced names are only used inside
    functions which are not invoked until after all of the loop has been
    loaded), this is very mildly undesirable, but OK. (Such imports should be
    marked by a comment as circular but OK.)

    HOWEVER, in places where the name is used in the code executed immediately
    (e.g. as a superclass for a class constructed in the module root), we have a
    problem. The referred-to name must *not* be imported first: something else
    from the circular import loop must be instead. For now, we can work around
    this by ordering our imports carefully in this file, but it’s not good
    enough; we desire to be able to import anything from Overture directly, thus
    enabling further dead-code removal.

    To list circular imports, install madge (from npm) and run this command:

        madge source/Overture --circular

    If it does not list exactly the five below, we’re in trouble and you’ll have
    to assess it all over again.

    Safe cycles that exist:

    - drag-drop/{Drag ↔ DragController}: not used in the global scope

    - dom/Element ↔ views/View: not used in the global scope

    Bad cycles that exist and are dependent on import order (marked elsewhere in
    this file by FIXME notes):

    - core/Date → localisation/LocaleController → localisation/Locale →
      core/Date: LocaleController uses Locale in the global scope

// FIXME(circular-imports): core/Date → localisation/LocaleController →
// localisation/Locale → core/Date, but LocaleController uses Locale
// immediately, so Locale must not be the first one imported. For now, core/Date
// is imported first and the crisis averted. Chris’s proposal to resolve this:
//
// 1. Do *something* with localisation/RelativeDate.js
//    (which is all side-effects on the global Date object, ick);
// 2. Merge localisation/{Locale, LocaleController}.js to just i18n.js;
// 3. Abolish the LocaleController export for good measure (O.i18n is nice,
//    singletons with a capital first letter aren’t).
