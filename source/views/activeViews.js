/**
    Property: O.activeViews

    Maps from id to the view object for all views currently in a document.

    Views with a manually specified ID are added using <O.Object#set>,
    and so you can observe them.

    For reasons of performance, views with automatically-generated IDs ('v1',
    'v372', &c.) bypass <O.Object#set>, and so they cannot be observed.
    (I canâ€™t think of any legitimate reasons for observing them anyway.)

    This object is maintained by <O.View#didEnterDocument> and
    <O.View#willLeaveDocument>; no code outside of those two methods is
    permitted to mutate it.
